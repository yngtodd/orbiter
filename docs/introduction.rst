Introduction
============

Orbiter is a simple control game created by `Lee Vaughan`_ using Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
The design of the game, along with its source code, was originally published in
Lee's excellent book, `Impractical Python Projects`_. I highly recommend Lee's book as well as many of
the other wonderful books offered by `No Starch Press`_.

This repository stands as a refactored version of Mr. Vaughan's source code. It was created with two aims: 
one, to make it simple to extend the game, and, more importantly, two, to make the game into an environment
for reinforcement learning algorithms in the style of OpenAI's `gyms`_.
